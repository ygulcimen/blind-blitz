# Production Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Build & TypeScript
- [x] TypeScript build passes without errors
- [x] Production bundle builds successfully (939 KB gzipped to 263 KB)
- [x] No critical type errors

### 2. Core Gameplay
- [x] Timer synchronization works correctly between players
- [x] Timer starts at 5:00 for both players
- [x] Timer ticks accurately in real-time
- [x] Timer updates correctly after moves
- [x] Timeout detection works (player loses when time runs out)

### 3. Game Mechanics
- [x] Draw offers work (offer/accept/decline)
- [x] Resignation works correctly (awards win to opponent)
- [x] Blind phase ‚Üí Reveal phase ‚Üí Live phase transitions work
- [x] Move validation works
- [x] Checkmate detection works
- [x] Stalemate detection works

### 4. Database
- [x] Supabase triggers handle timer updates automatically
- [x] Real-time subscriptions sync game state
- [x] Environment variables secured (.env not in git)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES (Non-Critical)

### Performance
- [ ] Bundle size is large (939 KB) - consider code splitting later
- [ ] 260+ console.log statements (cleaned critical ones, others won't affect users)

### Nice to Have (Future)
- [ ] Mobile optimization
- [ ] Accessibility (keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Analytics tracking
- [ ] Error reporting (Sentry/LogRocket)
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your production environment:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_key
```

### 2. Database Setup
Run this SQL in production Supabase:
```sql
-- Timer trigger (critical for gameplay)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_player_time_on_move()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
  time_elapsed_ms INTEGER;
  previous_player TEXT;
BEGIN
  IF NEW.last_move_time IS DISTINCT FROM OLD.last_move_time
     AND OLD.last_move_time IS NOT NULL
     AND NEW.last_move_time IS NOT NULL THEN

    time_elapsed_ms := EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NEW.last_move_time - OLD.last_move_time)) * 1000;

    previous_player := CASE
      WHEN NEW.current_turn = 'white' THEN 'black'
      ELSE 'white'
    END;

    IF previous_player = 'white' THEN
      NEW.white_time_ms := GREATEST(0, OLD.white_time_ms - time_elapsed_ms);
    ELSE
      NEW.black_time_ms := GREATEST(0, OLD.black_time_ms - time_elapsed_ms);
    END IF;
  ELSIF OLD.last_move_time IS NULL AND NEW.last_move_time IS NOT NULL THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Clock started at %', NEW.last_move_time;
  END IF;

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_player_time_on_move
  BEFORE UPDATE ON game_live_state
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_player_time_on_move();
```

### 3. Build & Deploy
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to your hosting (Vercel/Netlify/etc)
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Create a game and verify both players can join
- [ ] Play a full game (blind ‚Üí reveal ‚Üí live)
- [ ] Test timer synchronization with 2 browser windows
- [ ] Test resignation
- [ ] Test draw offer
- [ ] Test timeout (let timer run to 0:00)

## üìä PRODUCTION METRICS TO MONITOR

1. **Error Rate** - Check Supabase logs for errors
2. **Game Completion Rate** - How many games finish vs abandon
3. **Timer Accuracy** - Any reports of desynced timers
4. **Database Performance** - Query times, trigger performance
5. **User Complaints** - Check support channels

## üî• EMERGENCY ROLLBACK

If critical issues occur:
1. Revert to previous deployment
2. Check Supabase logs for errors
3. Disable problematic features via feature flags
4. Fix issues in development before redeploying

## üìù NOTES

- Timer system was completely rebuilt - most complex part
- Database trigger handles all time calculations
- Client only displays time, doesn't calculate it
- All tests passed successfully before deployment
