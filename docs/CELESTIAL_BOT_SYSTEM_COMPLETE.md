# 🤖 Celestial Bot System - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database (Supabase)
- ✅ 5 Marvel Celestial bot accounts in `players` table
- ✅ `is_bot` field added to identify bots
- ✅ `celestial_bot_configs` view with AI personalities
- ✅ Bot availability functions (one bot = one game)
- ✅ Bot injection functions for matchmaking

### 2. Bot AI Services
- ✅ `celestialBotAI.ts` - Blind + Live phase AI engine
- ✅ `celestialBotMatchmaking.ts` - Bot management
- ✅ `botInjectionService.ts` - Matchmaking injection
- ✅ `useCelestialBot.ts` - React hook for detection

### 3. Game Flow Integration
- ✅ **Waiting Room** - 8-second bot injection timer
- ✅ **Blind Phase** - Bot auto-generates & submits 5 moves
- ✅ **Live Phase** - Bot plays moves automatically

## 🎮 How It Works

### Matchmaking Flow
```
1. Player searches for game
2. Room created with 1 player
3. 8-second timer starts ⏱️
4. If no human joins → Bot injected 🤖
5. Bot marks ready after 1 second
6. Game starts normally
```

### Blind Phase
```
1. Human submits 5 blind moves
2. System detects bot opponent
3. Bot AI generates 5 strategic moves
4. Bot auto-submits moves
5. Game proceeds to reveal phase
```

### Live Phase
```
1. Live chess game begins
2. When it's bot's turn:
   - Bot AI calculates best move
   - Waits 1 second (feels natural)
   - Makes move automatically
3. Game continues until checkmate/draw
4. Rewards distributed normally
```

- [ ] Ran `sql/create_celestial_bots.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Ran `sql/bot_availability_functions.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] Verified 5 bots exist in `players` table

### Test 1: Bot Injection
- [ ] Start matchmaking
- [ ] Wait 8 seconds (don't let anyone join)
- [ ] Bot should auto-inject
- [ ] Bot should mark ready after 1 second
- [ ] Room should transition to payment/starting phase

### Test 2: Blind Phase
- [ ] Game starts in blind phase
- [ ] Submit your 5 blind moves
- [ ] Bot should auto-generate and submit moves (check console logs)

- [ ] Reveal phase completes
- [ ] Live phase starts
- [ ] When it's bot's turn, it should make moves automatically
- [ ] Game should feel natural (1-second delays)
- [ ] Game should end normally (checkmate/draw)

### Test 4: Rewards & Stats
- [ ] Game ends, rewards screen appears
- [ ] Check your gold balance increased/decreased correctly

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Bot not injecting
**Solution:** Check console for errors. Verify bot availability functions are in Supabase.

### Issue: Bot not submitting blind moves
**Solution:** Check console logs for "Bot generating blind phase moves...". Verify `useCelestialBot` hook is detecting bot game.

### Issue: Bot not making live moves
**Solution:** Check console for "Bot turn detected". Verify `celestialBotAI` is imported correctly.

### Issue: "No bot available" after 8 seconds
**Solution:** All bots might be in other games. Wait for them to finish or add more bots.
