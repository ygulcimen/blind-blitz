      question: 'What is the blind phase in BlindChess?',
      answer:
        "The blind phase is the opening part of every game where both players make their first 5 moves without seeing their opponent's moves. This tests strategic planning and intuition rather than memorized opening theory. After 5 moves, the board is revealed and the game continues as normal chess.",
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      category: 'economy',
      question: 'How does the gold system work?',
      answer:
        "Every move in BlindChess costs gold from your balance. Different game modes have different move costs. You start with 1000 gold as a new player and earn more by winning games. Managing your gold effectively is crucial - if you run out, you can't make moves!",
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      category: 'gameplay',
      question: "What's the difference between Classical and RoboChaos modes?",
      answer:
        'Classical mode follows traditional chess rules after the blind phase. RoboChaos mode has our AI generate chaotic opening positions that destroy traditional opening theory, forcing players to adapt quickly to unexpected situations.',
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      category: 'economy',
      question: 'Can I lose all my gold?',
      answer:
        "Yes, it's possible to lose all your gold if you're not careful with your moves. However, we provide daily login bonuses, achievement rewards, and free practice modes to help players rebuild their gold reserves. You can also purchase gold if needed.",
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      category: 'tournaments',
      question: 'How do tournaments work?',
      answer:
        'Tournaments are competitive events with entry fees and prize pools. They can be Classical-only, RoboChaos-only, or mixed format. Players compete in multiple rounds, and winners share the prize pool based on their final ranking.',
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      category: 'gameplay',
      question: 'Do I need to be a chess expert to play BlindChess?',
      answer:
        'Not at all! While chess knowledge helps, BlindChess rewards strategic thinking and adaptation over memorization. Many traditional chess masters struggle with the blind phase and economy management. We have beginner-friendly modes and tutorials.',
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      category: 'economy',
      question: 'How much does each move cost?',
      answer:
        'Move costs vary by game mode: Classical mode typically costs 10-20 gold per move, while RoboChaos can cost 25-50 gold per move due to higher stakes. Tournament games may have different cost structures.',
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      category: 'technical',
      question: 'What devices can I play on?',
      answer:
        'BlindChess is a web-based game that works on any modern browser. You can play on desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone. We also have dedicated mobile apps coming soon.',
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      category: 'tournaments',
      question: 'When are tournaments held?',
      answer:
        'We run tournaments continuously! There are daily tournaments, weekend specials, and monthly championships. Check the tournaments page for current and upcoming events.',
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      category: 'technical',
      question: 'Is my progress saved across devices?',
      answer:
        'Yes! Your account, gold balance, game history, and statistics are saved to our servers and sync across all your devices when you log in.',
    },
    {
      id: 11,
      category: 'economy',
      question: 'What happens if I disconnect during a game?',
      answer:
        "If you disconnect, the game will pause for up to 5 minutes. You can reconnect and continue. If you don't reconnect in time, it counts as a forfeit and you lose your entry fee, but no additional gold penalties apply.",
    },
    {
      id: 12,
      category: 'gameplay',
      question: 'Can I practice without spending gold?',
      answer:
        'Yes! We offer free practice modes against AI opponents where you can learn the rules, test strategies, and get comfortable with the interface without risking any gold.',
    },
