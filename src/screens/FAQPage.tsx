      question: 'What is the blind phase in BlindBlitz?',
      answer:
        "The blind phase is the opening part of every game where both players commit their first 5 moves without seeing their opponent's moves. This tests strategic planning and intuition rather than memorized opening theory. After 5 moves, the board reveals all moves simultaneously and the game continues as standard chess.",
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      category: 'economy',
      question: 'How does the gold system work?',
      answer:
        "You earn and spend gold (ðŸª™) to play games. Each game has an entry fee that goes into the prize pool. Winners take the pot! You start with 1000 gold as a new player. Earn more by winning matches, daily login bonuses, and achievements. Different stake levels (Pawn to King arenas) have different entry fees and rewards.",
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      category: 'gameplay',
      question: "What's the difference between Classical and RoboChaos modes?",
      answer:
        'Classical mode: Both players start from the standard chess position and play through the blind phase, then continue normally. RoboChaos mode: An AI bot makes the first 5 moves for BOTH players randomly during the blind phase, creating completely chaotic positions. You take over after the chaos and must adapt to whatever situation you inherit. It destroys opening theory!',
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      category: 'economy',
      question: 'What happens if I run out of gold?',
      answer:
        "Don't worry! We never leave players stranded. If your balance runs low, you can claim daily bonuses, complete achievements for rewards, or start fresh with our welcome-back bonus. Your account never gets locked - you always have a path back to playing.",
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      category: 'tournaments',
      question: 'How do tournaments work?',
      answer:
        'Tournaments are special competitive events (coming soon!) with larger prize pools. Entry requires a tournament ticket or higher entry fee. Players compete in multiple rounds, and winners share massive gold rewards. Watch for Weekend Blitz and Chaos Masters tournaments!',
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      category: 'gameplay',
      question: 'Do I need to be a chess expert to play BlindBlitz?',
      answer:
        'Not at all! While chess knowledge helps, BlindBlitz rewards strategic thinking and adaptation over memorization. The blind phase levels the playing field - even grandmasters can\'t rely on their opening repertoire. If you know how pieces move and basic tactics, you can compete!',
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      category: 'economy',
      question: 'How do stake levels work?',
      answer:
        'We have 6 stake levels (arenas): Pawn (10-24ðŸª™), Knight (25-49ðŸª™), Bishop (50-99ðŸª™), Rook (100-249ðŸª™), Queen (250-499ðŸª™), and King (500+ðŸª™). Higher stakes = higher risks and rewards. Winners in each arena earn rewards based on the entry fee. Choose your comfort level!',
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      category: 'technical',
      question: 'What devices can I play on?',
      answer:
        'BlindBlitz is a web-based game that works on any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Play on desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone - your account syncs everywhere. No downloads required!',
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      category: 'gameplay',
      question: 'How long does a typical game take?',
      answer:
        'Games are fast-paced! The blind phase (5 moves each) takes 2-5 minutes depending on your thinking time. The live phase varies based on the position but typically 5-15 minutes. Total game time: 10-20 minutes on average. Perfect for quick strategic battles!',
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      category: 'technical',
      question: 'Is my progress saved across devices?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely! Your account, gold balance, game history, rating, and all statistics are stored securely on our servers. Log in from any device and pick up right where you left off. Your data is always backed up and synced in real-time.',
    },
    {
      id: 11,
      category: 'technical',
      question: 'What happens if I disconnect during a game?',
      answer:
        "If you disconnect, you have a grace period to reconnect. During the blind phase, you'll have time to rejoin. In the live phase, your clock keeps running. If you're gone too long, the game may be forfeited. Always play on a stable connection!",
    },
    {
      id: 12,
      category: 'gameplay',
      question: 'Can I watch other players\' games?',
      answer:
        'Spectator mode is coming soon! You\'ll be able to watch high-stakes games in real-time, learn from top players, and follow tournament action. For now, focus on your own battles and climb the leaderboard!',
    },
